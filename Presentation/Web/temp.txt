Alright lets go to the next page, the next page is going to be to create simulations:
This simulations will be created answering forms, this is gonna be the main thing about the app so the ui/ux is crtitical here. 
The form is going to have various paramaters and some of them need to be filled in an others are optional

This are gonna be on the main tab

name: String, 
time: Int, 
exec_time: Int, 
seed_users: Int, optional
seed_servers: Int, optional
Type_exec: an int between 0-3 (this will be a select)
type_placement: an int between 0-3 (this will be a select)

Then we will have more tabs
now i would like the button to create simulations to be disabled till all mandatory camps are filled and also the the 3 extra tabs have no errors.

Also lets implements the extra tabs 

then we will have 3 more tabs to fill data, 
The next tab will be for creating
As i imagine them will have a list where you can see all the elements added till the moment and, then you will have a several inputs each for each atribute where you will be able to create this items and add them to the list

PossibleJobs: 
this will be an array of object that will have 
"cpu": int, "mem": int, "hdd": int, "probability": float 

the next tab will have
job_distributions": [
        {"initial_time": 0, "final_time": 50, "probability": 0.6},
        {"initial_time": 51, "final_time": 100, "probability": 0.4}
    ],
and the next tab 
    "servers": [
        {"cpu": 8, "mem": 32, "hdd": 1000, "availability": "H"},
        {"cpu": 4, "mem": 16, "hdd": 500, "availability": "M"}
    ]
